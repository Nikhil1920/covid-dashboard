## Frontend for Covid Dashboard App

Built using React JS, Next.js, Chart.js, TypeScript, and Material UI.

Avoided most next.js specific features like server side rendering, and client side rendering on purpose.

Just used next for routing.

Needs work to be done to abstract the functinality into smaller reusable components.
